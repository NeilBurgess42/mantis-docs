# How to configure the Mantis client

This section outlines how to configure the Mantis client. The Mantis client is flexible and its runtime behavior can be controlled through 3 main methods:

 - Using preconfigured config files
 - Creating a custom config file
 - Runtime configuration with command line arguments from the shell using "Dkey" flags

## Mantis Launcher

We recommend using the mantis-launcher for ease of use, especially if using standard config on an existing network.

To run Mantis using the luancher, do the following:

Navigate to the Mantis binaries root folder (ie. mantis/target/universal/mantis-3.0) and launch with network name.

```
cd mantis/target/universal/mantis-3.0
./mantis-launcher <config-name>
```

Replace <config-name> by whichever network you want to connect to and load that predefined network config which will include the corresponding `/chains/<chain-name>.conf` file. See [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/blob/develop/src/main/resources/application.conf#L284) fore more.

> Note: The main function of mantis-launcher is calling the `-Dconfig.file` configuration option with whatever parameter is being passed to it.


### Dkey usage

To change config options at runtime on commandline, you may use Dkey arguments and define the key and the value like so:

```
./mantis-launcher etc -Dkey=value
```

## Data folder

By default, the blockchain data, logs, keystore and all other files that Mantis creates are stored in the userâ€™s home folder under a sub folder called `.mantis`. Each network will have its own subfolder, so `etc` (`./mantis/etc`) for the Ethereum Classic mainnet, `mordor` (`./mantis/mordor`) for the testnet data, etc.

### Conf file

One way to change this setting is in the conf files. Look for, or add a mantis.datadir option like so:

```
mantis {
  # Base directory where all the data used by the node is stored, including blockchain data and private keys
  # datadir = ${user.home}"/.mantis/"${mantis.blockchains.network}
}
```

### Dkey

You can also change this setting by setting a Dkey parameter at runtime:

```
-Dmantis.keyStore.keystore-dir=/new/datadir/location/
```

> Note: You cannot use the `~` shortcut to define the new location.

## Discovery

The discovery function is active by default. The network is queried for additional potential nodes using a partial implementation of the kadelmia discovery protocol.

### Conf file

To prevent this and use only the bootstrap nodes as listed in the `network.conf` go to:
`# discovery-enabled = true`.
Now, you can change value `true` to `false` to disable the discovery functionality:
`discovery-enabled = false`.

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.network.discovery.discovery-enabled=true
```

## Fast sync

`Fast sync` will sync your local blockchain data faster than a full (or archival) sync. It will download blocks and only verify the proof of work of each block instead of downloading and reprocessing every transaction from genesis.

> Note: State tries are downloaded in parallel to blocks and will take considerably longer to do so.

### Conf file
Fast sync is enabled by default.
To disable this, you can edit the `sync.conf` by locating the following line:
`# do-fast-sync = true`

amd replace with 'true':
`do-fast-sync = false`

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.sync.do-fast-sync=false # to run without fast-sync
```

## Pruning

By default, the database is pruned of state trie nodes that are no longer needed.  You can prevent this functionality and keep all intermediate state nodes.

For this, edit the `storage.conf` file and replace `# mode = "basic"` with:
`mode = "archive"`.

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.pruning.mode=archive
```

## http RPC
Mantis supports all standard web3 JSON-RPC APIs.
To enable the HTTP server,

### Dkey
```
-Dmantis.network.rpc.http=false
```

-Dmantis.network.rpc.http.mode=http


## Notes:

> The main configuration file in Mantis is `application.conf`, located in `mantis/src/main/resources`. For fine tweaking, locate and edit that file.
