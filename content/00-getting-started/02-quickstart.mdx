# Mantis Client Quickstart

## Step 1: Get Mantis
To begin, choose your OS and download the prebuilt binary:

```
git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/mantis.git
cd mantis
```

## Step 2: Run the Client Node
The easiest way to launch the Mantis client is by using the `mantis-launcher` helper binary.

In order to run the node, you will first need to choose a network. For this, use one of the command-line options below:

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `eth`: Ethereum mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor testnet
* `mantistestnet`: Mantis testnet with additional ECIP features

Try running the node on the Mordor testnet:

```
./bin/mantis-launcher mordor # replace with any network name to connect to it
```

**That’s it!** <br/>
The launcher will start downloading blockchain data and synchronizing with the chain.
