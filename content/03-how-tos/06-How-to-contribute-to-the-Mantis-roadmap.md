# How to Contribute to the Mantis Roadmap

## Introduction

The Mantis team at IOHK is hard at work developing exciting new features for the Mantis client, and you are welcome to add your contribution.

## Ways you can help

There is much more to creating new features than coding. The developers welcome contributions in these areas:
- Ideas for improvement. Something specific to benefit all the people who use the Mantis wallet.
- Critiquing improvement candidates. Your knowledge and experience can help everyone, including yourself.
- Reviewing and suggesting improvements to code. A new set of eyes can often see something that the team has missed or could be improved.
- Improving documentation. Perhaps you find a topic that is not clear. Perhaps you see that annoying typo. The developers would love to hear from you.
