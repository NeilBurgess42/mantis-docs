# How to Contribute to the Mantis Roadmap

## Introduction

The Mantis team at IOHK is hard at work developing exciting new features for the Mantis client, and you are welcome to add your contribution.

## Ways you can help

The Mantis team welcomes offers of help. 

Writing code is valuable, but new code can be problematic to integrate into the existing code base.

There is much more to creating new features than coding. The developers welcome contributions in these areas:
- Ideas for improvement. The best ideas contribute something specific to benefit all the people who use the Mantis wallet.
- Critiquing improvement candidates. Your knowledge and experience can help everyone, including yourself.
- Reviewing and suggesting improvements to code. A new set of eyes can often see something that the team has missed or could be improved.
- Improving documentation. Perhaps you find a topic that is not clear. Perhaps you see that annoying typo. The developers would love to hear from you.
