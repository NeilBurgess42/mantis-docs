The Sagano testnet is a full-featured, experimental testnet, built to test protocol-level features proposed by the ETC community.
To learn more, see [here](#).

To join Sagano with Mantis, use the `sagano` network definition:

```
./bin/mantis-launcher sagano
```

The Sagano Faucet and Explorer are key tools needed in order to use the Sagano testnet correctly.

## Sagano Faucet

[Sagano Faucet](https://mantis-testnet-faucet-web.mantis.ws/)  
To support users in transacting on the Sagano testnet, this faucet allows users to easily claim test ETC by inputting their testnet address.
The Sagano Faucet sends 1 test ETC upon request, and each user can request funds once every 24 hours.  

## Sagano Explorer

[Sagano Explorer](https://mantis-testnet-explorer.mantis.ws/)  
This lightweight explorer allows users to monitor activity on the testnet. The explorer shows detailed transaction activity as well as labeling which blocks are checkpointing blocks.  

Future testnet releases look to support the evolution of  Ethereum Classic.
