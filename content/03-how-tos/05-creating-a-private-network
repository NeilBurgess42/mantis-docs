# How to set up a standalone private Mantis network

Private networks provide a great environment for testing purposes, which can have low or no difficulty for mining, and are much faster processing transactions than Ethereum Classic mainnet.
This section outlines how to set up a standalone private Mantis network.


## Create a custom conf file

In order to create a private network using Mantis, you will need to create a custom conf file. We will use eht `etc.conf` file as a template.

```
cp mantis/src/universal/conf/etc.conf mantis/src/universal/conf/custom.conf
```

Edit conf file to point to options

## Create custom genesis file

Edit a genesis file and/or make your own from scratch.


> Make sure to verify and define the initial allocations in the `alloc` key.


## Run Mantis on private network

```
./bin/mantis-launcher custom
```


That's it. Your network is setup and running.

## Optional

### Connect to explorer

###Connect to faucet

### Other clients

If you want other clients to connect to the private network, no further configuration is needed. They should be able to discover eachother and sync without a problem, so long as the network doens't have any new Sagano testnet features not implemented in other clients.
