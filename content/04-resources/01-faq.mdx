* Is Mantis a Wallet or a Node client?
  * Mantis is the [node client](#) and a [wallet](#). You can download them separately and use any according to your needs. These are delivered and released separately and each has its own installation and configuration options.
  The main differences between them is their usage. Node clients track the global chain state, while the wallet allows you to send and receive cryptocurrency transactions on chain. The client is a command line tool, and the wallet has a GUI interface.
* Will fast-sync change automatically once state is initially synced?
  * Yes, the sync mode changes to normal sync.
