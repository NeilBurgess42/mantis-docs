## Client Issues

* users might need to configure port forwarding manually for all TCP and UDP traffic, otherwise there might be problems with initial syncing
* when using `pruning`, there's a risk of losing MPT nodes which may block the syncing process

## Wallet Issues

* 1k block limit on transaction view and transactions disappearing on restart- Balance not impacted!
* Some RPC errors when connecting w/Mordor- the team is investigating their origin
* No separate address for different networks
