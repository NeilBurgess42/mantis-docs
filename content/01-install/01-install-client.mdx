This section outlines how to install the Mantis client on your Linux/macOS/Windows machine.

Follow these instructions to install the Mantis client or go [here for instructions to install the Mantis wallet](/install/install-wallet).


## Requirements

These are the prerequisites you need for installing Mantis:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version use `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
* 4G of memory (RAM)
    Additional RAM is needed for the DAG file _if mining_ is enabled.
* 100GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. 
  An overhead will be needed for future growth of the chain. An SSD of at least 500G is recommended for full sync.


## Install

To install Mantis, follow these steps:

1. Download the client binary zip archive from the [Mantis releases page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases).

2. Move the zip file to your preferred folder and unzip the client archive file. Finally, remove the zip file.

> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](/first-steps/downloads#checksum) for instructions.


```
mv mantis-3.1.0.zip /home/<user>/bin/
cd /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-3.1.0.zip
rm mantis-3.1.0.zip
```

3. (Optional) Rename your mantis bin folder for ease of future updates.

```
mv /home/<user>/bin/mantis-3.1.0 /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```

> Default folders for applications on Linux are `/home/<user>/Applications` and `/home/<user>/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. We recommend placing the mantis folder in there.


4. Now you can run the client from its install folder.

```
./bin/mantis
```

This command will run the client in the foreground with settings as defined in the `conf` folder files.


## PATH
5. (Optional, but recommended) Add the binary to your PATH. Add the following line to your `.profile`/`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` (or equivalent). Source the profile file.

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/mantis-3.1.0/bin
source ~/.profile
```

Now you can execute the client from any folder by running `mantis`.


## Update

In order to update the Mantis client, simply replace the mantis folder with the newer version.

```
mv mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```
