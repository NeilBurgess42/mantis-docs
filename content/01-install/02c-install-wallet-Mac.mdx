>Author's note to reviewers: The original document describes disk space requirements for syncing and mining. I didn't think a wallet did those things. Please clarify. Also please check the Mac instructions; I do not have a Mac machine. 

There are two Mantis applications you can use: the Mantis client and the Mantis wallet. You can download either or both.

This section outlines how to install the Mantis wallet on your Apple Mac machine. For instructions to install the Mantis client, you can go [here](/install/install-client-mac).

## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for installing Mantis Wallet:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version, use `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
    (Note that  the Mantis team has not tested the wallet with JVM 1.9 or later versions)
* 4G of memory (RAM)
* 250GB of disk space.

##  Installing the wallet

To install Mantis wallet, follow these steps:

1. Choose and download the Apple Mac installer from the wallet quick-start page:
![Apple Mac Installer](../images/2c-Download-Installer.png)
Note the checksum.
```
Mantis-Wallet-<version>.AppImage
Mantis-Wallet-<version>.dmg
Mantis-Wallet.Setup.<version>.exe
```
> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](first-steps/downloads#checksum) for instructions.

4. Move the binary file to your preferred folder and unzip the client archive file. Finally, remove the zip file.

```
mv Mantis-Wallet-3.1.0.AppImage /home/<user>/bin/
cd /home/<user>/bin/
```

> Default folders for applications on Linux are `/home/<user>/Applications` and `/home/<user>/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. We recommend placing the Mantis folder in there.


5. Now, you can run the wallet by double-clicking the file or running it through your Desktop environment.

As soon as it starts, the Mantis wallet begins synchronizing with the environment you have started it in. In the image, it is started in the Sagano Testnet.

## Update

To update the Mantis wallet, replace the binary with the newer version and use the new file instead of the older one.

```
mv Mantis-Wallet-<newer-version>.AppImage /home/<user>/bin/
```
