This section outlines how to install the Mantis client on your Windows machine.

Follow these instructions to install the Mantis client or go [here for instructions to install the Mantis wallet](/install/install-wallet).


## Requirements

These are the prerequisites for installing Mantis:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version, use `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
    (Note that the Mantis team has not tested the client with JVM 1.9 or later versions)
* 4G of memory (RAM)
    Additional RAM is needed for the DAG file _if mining_ is enabled.
* 250GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. You will need more than that for the future growth of the chain. An SSD of at least 500G is recommended for full sync.


## Install

To install Mantis, follow these steps:

1. Download the client binary from the Mantis Client page at [MantisClient.io](https://mantisclient.io/):
![Mantis Client page](../images/1-Download-Client.png).

2. Choose and download the correct installer from the Client quick-start page:
![Windows Installer](../images/2-Download-Installer.png)
Choose the Windows 64 bit installer, and note the checksum.

> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](/first-steps/downloads#checksum) for instructions.


```
mv mantis-3.1.0.zip /home/<user>/bin/
cd /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-3.1.0.zip
rm mantis-3.1.0.zip
```

3. (Optional) Rename your mantis bin folder for ease of future updates.

```
mv /home/<user>/bin/mantis-3.1.0 /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```

> Default folders for applications on Linux are `/home/<user>/Applications` and `/home/<user>/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. We recommend placing the mantis folder in there.


4. Now, you can run the client from its install folder.

```
./bin/mantis
```

This command runs the client in the foreground with settings as defined in the `conf` folder files.


## PATH
5. (Optional, but recommended) Add the binary to your PATH. Add the following line to your `.profile`/`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` (or equivalent). Source the profile file.

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/mantis-3.1.0/bin
source ~/.profile
```

Now you can execute the client from any folder by running `mantis`.


## Update

To update the Mantis client, replace the mantis folder with the newer version.

```
mv mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```
