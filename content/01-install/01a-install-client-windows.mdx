Follow these instructions to install the Mantis client on your Windows machine or alternatively use [the Mantis wallet instructions](/install/install-wallet).


## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for installing Mantis:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version, use `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
    (Note that the Mantis team has not tested the client with JVM 1.9 or later versions)
* 4G of memory (RAM)
    Additional RAM is needed for the DAG file _if mining_ is enabled.
* 250GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. You will need more than that for the future growth of the chain. An SSD of at least 500G is recommended for full sync.


## Installing Mantis

To install Mantis, follow these steps:

1. Download the client binary from the [Mantis Client page](https://mantisclient.io/):
![Mantis Client page](../images/1-Download-Client.png).

2. Choose the Windows 64 bit installer  to download from the Client quick-start page:
![Windows Installer](../images/2-Download-Installer.png)
3. Note the checksum.

> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](/first-steps/downloads#checksum) for instructions.


```
mv mantis-3.1.0.zip /home/<user>/bin/
cd /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-3.1.0.zip
rm mantis-3.1.0.zip
```

3. (Optional) Rename your mantis bin folder for ease of future updates.

```
mv /home/<user>/bin/mantis-3.1.0 /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```

> Default folders for applications on Linux are `/home/<user>/Applications` and `/home/<user>/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. We recommend placing the mantis folder in there.


4. Now, you can run the client from its install folder, as follows:

```
./bin/mantis
```

This command runs the client in the foreground with settings as defined in the `conf` folder files.


## Adding the Binary to the PATH
This is an optional step, but is recommended.

5. Add the binary to your PATH by adding the following line to your `.profile`/`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` (or equivalent). Source the profile file.

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/mantis-3.1.0/bin
source ~/.profile
```

Now you can execute the client from any folder by running `mantis`.


## Updating the Mantis Client

To update the Mantis client, replace the mantis folder with the newer version.

```
mv mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/
unzip mantis-<newer-version>.zip /home/<user>/bin/mantis
```
