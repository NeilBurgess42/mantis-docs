>Author's note to reviewers: The original document describes disk space requirements for syncing and mining. I didn't think a wallet did those things. Please clarify.

There are two Mantis applications you can use: the Mantis client and the Mantis wallet. You can download either or both.

This section outlines how to install the Mantis wallet on your Windows machine. For instructions to install the Mantis client, you can go [here](/install/-install-client-windows).


## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for installing Mantis wallet:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version, use
     `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
    (Note that the Mantis team has not tested the wallet with JVM 1.9 or later versions)
* 4G of memory (RAM)

* 250GB of disk space.

## Installing the wallet

To install Mantis wallet, follow these steps:

1. Download the wallet binary from the Mantis wallet page at [MantisClient.io](https://mantisclient.io/):
![Mantis wallet page](../images/1-Download.png).

2. Choose and download the Windows 64 bit installer from the wallet quick-start page:

3. Note the checksum.
> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](first-steps/downloads#checksum) for instructions.

4. Execute the binary file to run the installer. It is a standard Windows installer.

> The default installation folder is Program Files/Mantis. We recommend placing the Mantis files there.


5. Now, you can run the wallet by double-clicking its executable or running it through your desktop environment. The installation process adds a shortcut to your start menu.

As soon as it starts, the Mantis wallet begins synchronizing with the environment you have started it in. In the image, it is started in the Sagano Testnet.

To update the Mantis wallet, download a new installer and repeat the installation process.
