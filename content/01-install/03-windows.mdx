# How to install Mantis on Windows

This section outlines how to install the Mantis client on your Windows machine.

## Requirements
These are the requirements that are needed for installing Mantis on Windows:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x. <br/>
      To check the JVM version use java -version.
  (Note that the client has not been tested with JVM 1.9)
* 2G of memory (RAM) for the node to perform optimally.  Additional RAM is needed for the DAG file if *mining* is enabled.
* 50GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. An overhead will be needed for future growth of the chain.
* An SSD of at least 350G is recommended.
* Check the output for 64-Bit

To install Mantis on Windows, follow these steps:
1. Download the client binary zip archive from the [Mantis releases page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases).
2. Unzip the client archive file. <br/>
   This will create a structure where the `lib` folder contains all the JAR files required to run the client, the `conf` folder contains the configuration files needed to alter the    user settings of the client, and the `bin` folder contains the scripts to start the client.

To run the Mantis client, follow these steps:
1. From the `mantis-1.0-cli-rc1` folder use:
  `./bin/mantis`<br/>
  This command will run the client in the foreground with settings as dictated in the conf folder files.
