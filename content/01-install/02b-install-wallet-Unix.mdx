>Author's note to reviewers: Please check the unix instructions; I do not have a unix machine. Linux or unix?

There are two Mantis applications you can use: the Mantis client and the Mantis wallet. You can download either or both.

Follow these instructions to install the Mantis wallet. For instructions to install the Mantis client, you can go [here](/install/install-client-unix).


## Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites for installing Mantis wallet:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.
    To check the JVM version, use
     `java -version`.
    To install Java, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
    (Note that  the Mantis team has not tested the wallet with JVM 1.9 or later versions)
* 4G of memory (RAM)
* 250GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. You will need more than that for the future growth of the chain. An SSD of at least 500GB is recommended for full sync.

## Installing the wallet

To install Mantis wallet, follow these steps:

1. Download the wallet binary from the wallet page at [MantisClient.io](https://mantisclient.io/):
![Mantis wallet page](../images/1-Download.png).
Choose and download the Linux installer from the wallet quick-start page:
![Linux Installer](../images/2b-Download-Installer.png)

```
Mantis-Wallet-<version>.AppImage
Mantis-Wallet-<version>.dmg
Mantis-Wallet.Setup.<version>.exe
```
2. Note the checksum.
> Remember to run checksum verification on your downloads. Refer to [this section](first-steps/downloads#checksum) for instructions.

3. Move the binary file to your preferred folder and unzip the client archive file. Finally, remove the zip file.

```
mv Mantis-Wallet-3.1.0.AppImage /home/<user>/bin/
cd /home/<user>/bin/
```

> Default folders for applications on Linux are `/home/<user>/Applications` and `/home/<user>/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`. We recommend placing the Mantis folder in there.

4. Now, you can run the wallet by double-clicking the file or running it through your Desktop environment.

During startup, Mantis wallet allows you to choose the network. The network is the blockchain to synchronize with. This is the splash screen:

For information on the available networks, see [this page](/how-tos/Getting-Started-with-Mantis)

As soon as it starts, the Mantis wallet begins synchronizing with the environment you have started it in. In the image, it is started in the Sagano Testnet.

## Updating the wallet

To update the Mantis wallet, replace the binary with the newer version and use the new file instead of the older one.
```
mv Mantis-Wallet-<newer-version>.AppImage /home/<user>/bin/
```
