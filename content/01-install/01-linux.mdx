# How to install Mantis on Linux

This section outlines how to install the Mantis client on your Linux machine.

## Requirements
These are the prerequisites you need for installing Mantis on Linux:
* A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with version 1.8.x.<br/>
    To check the JVM version use java -version.<br/>
    To install Java on Linux, follow [these instructions](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html#linux).
* (Note that the client has not been tested with JVM 1.9)
* 2G of memory (RAM) for the node to perform optimally.  Additional RAM is needed for the DAG file _if mining_ is enabled.
* 50GB of disk space to ensure fast sync of the node. An overhead will be needed for future growth of the chain. An SSD of at least 350G is recommended.


To install Mantis on Linux, follow these steps:
1. Download the client binary zip archive from the [Mantis releases page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases).
2. Unzip the client archive file. <br/>
   This will create a structure where the `lib` folder contains all the JAR files required to run the client, the `conf` folder contains the configuration files needed to alter the user settings of the client, and the `bin` folder contains the scripts to start the client.

To run the Mantis client, follow these steps:
1. From the `mantis-1.0-cli-rc1` folder use:
  `./bin/mantis`<br/>
  This command will run the client in the foreground with settings as dictated in the conf folder files.
