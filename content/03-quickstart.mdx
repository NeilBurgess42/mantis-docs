# Mantis Client Quickstart

## Step 1: Get Mantis
To begin, choose your OS and download the prebuilt binary.

```
git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/mantis.git
cd mantis
```

## Step 2: Run the Client Node
The easiest way to launch the Mantis client is by using the `mantis-launcher` helper binary.

In order to run the node, you will need to choose a network. These are the command line options to choose one.

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `eth`: Ethereum mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor Testnet
* `mantistestnet`: Mantis Testnet with additional ECIP features

Lets first try running the node on the Mordor network.

```
./bin/mantis-launcher mordor # replace with any network name to connect to it
```

**That’s it!** <br/>
The launcher will start downloading the blockchain data and synchronize with the chain.
