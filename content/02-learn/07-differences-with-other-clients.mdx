Several attributes separate Mantis from other Ethereum classic clients:

  - Mantis is the only client **built from scratch**, specifically for the Ethereum Classic Network
  - It is built in [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/), an object oriented and functional programming language
  - Mantis **implements new ECIP proposal features** that could shape the future of the Ethereum network
  - **Sagano is the new Mantis Testnet** you can use in order to test these new features
  - Mantis is a **node client and a wallet**, depending on what needs you have, you may choose one or the other
