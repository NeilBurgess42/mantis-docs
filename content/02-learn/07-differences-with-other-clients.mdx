Several attributes separate Mantis from other Ethereum classic clients:

  - Mantis is the only client **built from scratch**, specifically for the Ethereum Classic Network
  - It is built in [**Scala**](https://www.scala-lang.org/), programming language that allows build software using object oriented design on high level (DDD, hexagonal architecture) and use functional programming principles: immutability, referential transparency and lazy IO on low level. Thanks to advanced type systems, we eliminate many errors. Moreover it supports an actor model that naturally fits into the cryptocurrency world, as well as other approaches to concurrency like STM or green fibers. Scala programs running on JVM enjoy high & reliability enterprise grade reliability.
  - Mantis **implements new ECIP proposal features** that could shape the future of the Ethereum network
  - **Sagano is the new Mantis Testnet** you can use in order to test these new features
  - Mantis is a **node client and a wallet**, depending on what needs you have, you may choose one or the other
