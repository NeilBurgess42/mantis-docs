The purpose of the checkpointing system is to provide the Ethereum Classic blockchain with 51% attack resistance,
giving protection to the chain and confidence to its users that the system is secure.
> Note: 51% attacks occur when some miners (more than 50% of the network's miners) collude to cause network disruption.

## Motivation

Proof of work blockchains need high amounts of hash power (mining participation) to secure a network. Ethereum Classic has undergone several 51% attacks in the past due to low mining participation.  
Checkpointing defends against these attacks by using a checkpointing federation of nodes to guarantee the blockchain's integrity. The checkpointing federation is a set of external participants that provides independent verification of a group of blocks.
This solution is a temporary measure, and as soon as there are enough network participants, it will no longer be needed.

## Solution

The blockchain's headers contain an additional value indicating a checkpointed position. The checkpointing federation validates this checkpoint position. The checkpoint indicates that the chain has been proven correct up to that point.

As a user, you know that a transaction is safe if it is on the chain at or before the block with the checkpoint.

The underlying technology used to coordinate the issuing of checkpoints is a variant of the Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol, the [Ouroboros BFT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1049.pdf).
