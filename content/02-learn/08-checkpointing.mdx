Via it’s Checkpointing System, the Sagano testnet provides the Ethereum Classic blockchain with 51% attack resistance, giving protection to the chain and confidence to the user that the system is secure.



## Requirements
In order to use checkpointing, an OBFT checkpointing node network must be running and it must:

* Periodically produces checkpoint blocks
* (TBD) The produced checkpoint blocks don’t belong on different forks from ETC


## Parameters

* checkpoint-public-keys*: Public key of each member of the federation
* ecip-1097-block-number*: Hard fork block number when checkpointing will be activated


## Definitions
An important distinction is between:

*Checkpoint blocks*: block with the federation signatures
*Checkpointed blocks*: parent blocks of the checkpoint blocks

Chains with checkpoint blocks should be given priority over those without them, whereas the longer chain (with the most difficulty) is of secondary importance.


#### Rationale
Chains with checkpoint blocks should be given priority over those without them, whereas the longer chain (with the most difficulty) is of secondary importance.


#### Implementation
Instead of comparing chains by total difficulty, we’ll be comparing them by (lastCheckpointBlock, totalDifficulty).


This affects:
- Comparison between branches when importing blocks
- Comparison between peers as lastCheckpointBlock has to be added to their information
- Network messages that had totalDifficulty should now have lastCheckpointBlock as well
