Via itâ€™s Checkpointing System, This provides the Ethereum Classic blockchain with 51% attack resistance, giving protection to the chain and confidence to the user that the system is secure.

## Motivation

Proof of work blockchain need high amounts of hash power (mining participation) in order to have a secure network. Ethereum Classic has undergone several 51% in the past months due to low mining participation. Among other proposed solutions, checkpointing helps mitigate these attacks while employing a set of external participants that assist in guaranteeing the ledger's properties.
This solution is proposed as a temporary measure and once hash power has been regained, it will no longer be needed.

## Solution

The Blockchain's headers will contain an additional value indicating a checkpointed position. This checkpoint position will be validated by the set of external participants and will indicate that the chain has been fully proof checked up to that point.

As a user, you will be able to know that a transaction is safe if said transaction is on or before the block the checkpoint was issued.

The underlying technology used to coordinate the issuing of the checkpoints is a variant of the Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol, the [Ouroboros BFT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1049.pdf).
