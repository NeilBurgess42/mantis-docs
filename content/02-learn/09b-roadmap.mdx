Future Implementations and development efforts for Mantis can be reviewed in this Discussion Roadmap.

> Note: As a discussion roadmap, this isn't definite and will highly depend on where the Ethereum Classic community chooses to focus its efforts.

## Audits

Initial & Regular security audits of Client and Wallet.
Systematic evaluation of the clientâ€™s information system

## Miner Integration

Performance improvements and better compatibility with mining for:
* CPU
* GPU
* ASICs

## PRISM Consensus

New proof-of-work consensus protocol that provably achieves throughput and latency while retaining the strong guarantees, removing bottlenecks for Smart Contracts

## Keccak256

[ECIP 1049](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13)
Implementation of the Keccak256 Proof of Work Algorithm in Mantis
Will add security and simpler Layer2 implementations.

## KEVM + Firefly

A superior, formalized VM supported by Firefly tooling, helping Ethereum smart contract developers write better code

## NiPoPoWs

Interoperability and speed, Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work will allow users to sync nodes in just a few seconds, without using centralized services. Move your ETC back and forth to other chains.

## Coded Merkle Trees

New hash accumulator that offers a constant-cost protection against data
availability attacks.
