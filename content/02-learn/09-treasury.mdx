## Context

At IOHK, we believe that community input is essential to deliver a robust Ethereum Classic roadmap and execute its plans by attracting talented DApp developers. Promoting greater engagement is crucial for establishing independence and ultimately, this grants the ecosystem sustainability for *innovation, stability, and growth*.

Since the proposal introduces a change at protocol level, the Proto-Treasury introduces simple on-chain governance and built-in obsolescence trigger in order for the community to directly assess its value.
In other words, if it fails to meet expectations, it will be able to shut off.

Introducing a large change at the protocol level, the Proto-Treasury proposes straightforward on-chain governance and built-in obsolescence triggers in order for the community to directly assess its value.
In other words, in case the proposal does not meet expectations, it will stop operating. 

## Motivation

The motivation for having a treasury in place is to establish a steady funding income in order for a blockchain to become sustainable. Additionally, recent security problems – seen in the current Ethereum Classic blockchain – position a threat to 51% attacks, which requires a need for consistent innovation in order to guarantee the project’s support and development. 

> Note: 51% attacks occur when a group of miners (of more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate) decide to collude in order to cause network disruption.

While the network security can be increased through other means (including another proposal of ours, [ECIP 1097](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1097)), it doesn't appear to be the best, long-term solution.
Therefore, establishing the treasury for funding purposes ensures a clear vision of the substantial system maintenance focused to obtain innovation and diversity from other projects, including proof of stake (PoS) and newer blockchains.

The Proto-Treasury will offer sustainable and consistent funding for the Ethereum Classic underlying blockchain development and maintenance.

## Solution

The proposed Proto-Treasury solution is straightforward in its optimization for speed and implementation. The treasury system also includes a specification and a Solidity smart contract that can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc_treasury_system).

If the proposal is accepted, it foresees to distribute 80% of existing mining rewards to miners and 20% to the Proto-Treasury smart contract. This treasury will then be distributed according to the community decision.

Miners will be able to choose whether to send 20% to the Proto-Treasury or burn rewards through an op-out mechanism.

If the proposal is not accepted, and the Proto-Treasury smart contracts are not active, miners will recover access to full rewards by default.

### Distribution

Initially, the treasury funds are going to be distributed to three teams of client developers and the open community fund, where 30% will be allocated to each team and 10% - to the open community fund.

Through the on-chain smart contract governance, a super-majority vote of 60% will be enough to add or remove members from the smart contract as well as to close the whole treasury.
