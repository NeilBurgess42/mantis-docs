# Client and Wallet

Mantis is the nodeâ€™s *client and a wallet*. You can download them separately and use any according to your needs. These are delivered and released separately and each has its own installation and configuration options.
The client is a CLI tool made for advanced users and node maintainers, and the wallet has an easy-to-use GUI interface for cryptocurrency management and visualization of networks.


## Node Client
The Mantis client is a full node command-line tool built in Scala. It is compatible with the Ethereum Classic mainnet, the mordor testnet, as well as with other proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum-like networks.

Additionally, the Mantis team has implemented Sagano testnet features into its core and therefore, Mantis can be used in order to navigate the network and its features such as Checkpointing and/or the Proto-Treasury system.

## Wallet

The Mantis wallet is a graphical interface wallet that can interact with the Ethereum Classic network. You can send and receive transactions, create or restore Ethereum accounts, and view balances. Since the wallet incorporates and runs its own backend built on Mantis, it is fully autonomous and doesn't require an additional instance of Mantis running alongside. The wallet is compatible with and can be tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
