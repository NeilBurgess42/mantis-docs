# Client and Wallet

Mantis is the node’s *client and a wallet*. You can download them separately and use either or both according to your needs. They are delivered and released separately, and each has specific installation and configuration options.
Both are compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Both are compatible with the Ethereum Classic mainnet, the mordor testnet, and other proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum-like networks.

For development, Mantis integrates particularly well with the Sagano testnet. The Sagano testnet includes Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIPs) covering such features as Checkpointing and the Proto-Treasury system.

## Client
>Todo: Expand on this
The Mantis client is a full node command-line tool, built with Scala and made for advanced users and node maintainers.  


## Wallet

The Mantis wallet is a graphical interface wallet. You can send and receive transactions, create or restore Ethereum accounts, and view balances. Since the wallet incorporates and runs its own backend built on Mantis, it is fully autonomous and doesn’t require an additional instance of Mantis running alongside.
