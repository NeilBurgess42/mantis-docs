# Client and Wallet

Mantis is a *node client and a wallet*. You can download them separately and use whichever fits your needs better. These are delivered and released separately and each has its own installation and configuration options.
The main difference between them is that the client is a CLI client tool, and the wallet has a GUI interface.

## Node Client
The Mantis client is a full node command line tool built in Scala. It is compatible with the Ethereum Classic mainnet, the mordor testnet, as well other POW (Proof of work) ethereum-like networks.

On top of that, the Mantis team has implemented the Sagano testnet features into its core and therefore, Mantis can be used in order to navigate that network and its features such as Checkpointing and/or the Propto-Treasury system.

## Wallet

The Mantis wallet is a graphical interface wallet that can interact with the Ethereum Classic network. You can send and receive transactions, create/restore Ethereum accounts, view balances.
Since the wallet incorporates and runs its own backend built on Mantis, it is fully autonomous, and doesnâ€™t need an additional instance of Mantis running alongside it.
The wallet is compatible and tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
