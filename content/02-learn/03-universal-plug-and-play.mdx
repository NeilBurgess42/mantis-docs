# Introduction

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a feature that allows a Mantis node to participate in network discovery, even when it is behind a router. Network discovery is an essential precondition for ledger synchronization.

# More information

For a Mantis node to participate in the chosen network, it needs to discover other peers in the network and allow other peers to discover it.

 Your node cannot respond to other nodes unless it can receive messages from them. UPnP will attempt to find and enable suitable ports to allow incoming connections. 

 UPnP will not work for all devices. If it does not work for your device, you need to disable UPnP and configure port forwarding in your router to set the correct incoming port numbers.

# Configuring Mantis for UPnP

UPnP is enabled by default.  

To disable UPnP, the parameter `mantis.network.automatic-port-forwarding` must be set to `false`.
