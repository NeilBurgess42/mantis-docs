# What is Mantis?

[Mantis](https://mantisproject.io) is a full-featured client and wallet developed from the ground up for the [Ethereum Classic](http://ethereumclassic.org/) network written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Created by [IOHK](http://iohk.io/) in order to add robustness and variety to the ETC's client share, it includes optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability and performance in the long term.

The software follows the official [Ethereum Classic specification and roadmap](https://ethereumclassic.org/knowledge/roadmap) and also implements [ECIPs](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) proposed by various ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem.
