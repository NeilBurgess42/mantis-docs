Choose whether you'd like to use [the client](#mantisclientquickstart) or [the wallet](#mantiswalletquickstart).

# Mantis Client Quickstart

## Step 1: Download Mantis
To begin, choose your OS and download the [latest release](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases/latest).

## Step 2: Run the Client Node
The easiest way to launch the Mantis client is by using the `mantis-launcher` helper script.

To run the node, you will first need to choose a network. For this, use one of the following command-line options:

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor testnet
* `sagano`: Mantis testnet with additional ECIP features

Try running the node on the Mordor testnet:

```
./bin/mantis-launcher mordor # replace with any of the above network names to connect to it
```

**Chain Synchronization** <br/>
The launcher will start downloading blockchain data and synchronizing with the chain.

# Mantis Wallet Quickstart

Download and run the wallet's packaged binary.

```
cd Applications
wget https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis-wallet/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc3/Mantis-Wallet-0.1.0.AppImage
```

To run the wallet, double click the `AppImage/dmg/exe` or run it on command line.

```
./Mantis-Wallet-0.1.0.AppImage # replace with current version and correct OS option
```

Once the Mantis splash screen is finished loading, visit the `Settings` menu and ensure you are connected to the correct Network.

> Note: The wallet runs a Mantis client behind the scenes and will need to synchronize with the network initially. This might take several hours, depending on which network it connects to.
