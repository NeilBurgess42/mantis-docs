# Mantis Client Quickstart

## Step 1: Download Mantis
To begin, choose your OS and download the [latest release](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases/latest).

## Step 2: Run the Client Node
The easiest way to launch the Mantis client is by using the `mantis-launcher` helper script.

To run the node, you will first need to choose a network. For this, use one of the following command-line options:

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor testnet
* `sagano`: Mantis testnet with additional ECIP features

Check your client version :

```
cd <mantis-install-folder>
./mantis -h
```

Try running the node on the Mordor testnet:

```
./bin/mantis-launcher mordor # replace with any of the above network names to connect to it
```

**Chain Synchronization** <br/>
The launcher will start downloading blockchain data and synchronizing with the chain.


For alternate install methods, visit the [install section](/install).

## Step 3: Confirm Mantis is running

This step only works if you start your client with the [HTTP access enabled](/how-tos/querying-the-json-rpc-api).

```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8546
```

This request will call the [`eth_syncing`](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_syncing) method and should return a `json` format response like the following:

```
{
  "id":1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    startingBlock: '0x384',
    currentBlock: '0x386',
    highestBlock: '0x454'
  }
}
```

Or a false result when syncing is finished:
  
```
{
  "id":1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": false
}
```
