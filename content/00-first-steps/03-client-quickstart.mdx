# Mantis Client Quickstart

## Step 1: Download Mantis
To begin, choose your OS and download the [latest release](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases/latest).

## Step 2: Run the Client Node
The easiest way to launch the Mantis client is by using the `mantis-launcher` helper script.

To run the node, you will first need to choose a network. For this, use one of the following command-line options:

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor testnet
* `sagano`: Mantis testnet with additional ECIP features

Check your client version :

```
cd <mantis-install-folder>
./mantis -h
```

Try running the node on the Mordor testnet:

```
./bin/mantis-launcher mordor # replace with any of the above network names to connect to it
```

**Chain Synchronization** <br/>
The launcher will start downloading blockchain data and synchronizing with the chain.


For alternate install methods, visit the [install section](/install).
