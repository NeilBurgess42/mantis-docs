# What is Mantis?

[Mantis](https://mantisproject.io) is a fully featured client and wallet, which is developed from the ground up and written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for the [Ethereum Classic](http://ethereumclassic.org/) network (ETC). Created by [IOHK](http://iohk.io/) to add robustness and variety to the ETC's client share, it includes optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term.

The software follows the official [Ethereum Classic specification and roadmap](https://ethereumclassic.org/knowledge/roadmap) and also implements Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals ([ECIPs](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/)) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem.

# Downloads

Mantis runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
There are three main methods to run the Mantis client:

* using prebuilt-binaries (recommended)
* using binary archive
* building from source ([follow these instructions to build a client from source](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis-docs/blob/main/content/01-install/04-building-from-source.mdx)).

You can find detailed information on how to install each version in the [Install and Build](#/install) section.
