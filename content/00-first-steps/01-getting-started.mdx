# What is Mantis?
[Mantis](https://mantisclient.io) is a fully-featured **client and wallet UI**, developed from the ground up and written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for the [Ethereum Classic](http://ethereumclassic.org/) network (ETC). Created by [IOHK](http://iohk.io/) to add robustness and variety to the ETC's client range, it includes optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term.

The software follows the official [Ethereum Classic specification and roadmap](https://ethereumclassic.org/knowledge/roadmap) and also implements Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals ([ECIPs](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/)). The ETC community has a formal process for managing ECIP changes.

# Which network?
Decide which network to use. Mantis provides access to three networks:

* `etc`: Ethereum Classic mainnet
* `mordor`: Mordor testnet
* `sagano`: Mantis testnet with additional ECIP features

The most usual decision is to use the Sagano testnet until you become familiar with Mantis.
> Warning: Mantis Wallet is a beta version and has not been security audited. We recommend you do not carry out transactions with significant ETC amounts when connected to the Ethereum Classic mainnet.

# Client or Wallet?
Your next step is choosing whether you'd like to download and use the Mantis wallet or the Mantis client.

The wallet has a friendly graphical interface, while the client is a command-line interface tool.

For more details, see [this document](/learn/mantis-client-wallet).
